  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday was <a href="http://launchacademy.com">Launch Academy’s</a> first ever Ship it! Saturday, a day-long hackathon with the goal of creating something of value and launching it. Current and past launchers as well as members of the Ruby community in Boston were in attendance. It was an excellent way to use the skills I’m learning and switching gears for a day to refresh the mind.</p>

<p>For my project I wanted to create an open-sourced tool to improve how people consume information on mobile devices. I browse the web on my iPhone regularly and appreciate responsive design and love seeing fresh approaches to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction_design">interaction design</a>. I’m particularly interested in single-page interactive designs made possible by JavaScript. Here are some cool examples I’ve come across lately (compare desktop and mobile device to see what I mean):</p>

<ul>
<li>  <a href="http://acumen.org/">Acumen</a> &ndash; A non-profit tackling poverty.</li>
<li>  <a href="http://www.atomworks.co/">Website of Leonard Burton</a> &ndash; freelance front-end designer and developer</li>
</ul>


<p>I wanted to try my hand at creating a novel interaction suited for mobile devices using technologies that I’ve been learning. The system I created consists of animated tabs revealing pages of information that is suitable for a basic profile page or something similar. I used CSS3 animations combined with jQuery to achieve the effects. The site is hosted on <a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> and anyone is welcome to fork it as well as contribute. Check out <a href="http://alnoorpirani.com/tabtastic">Tabtastic</a> and let me know what you think.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Campaign Delta at <a href="http://www.launchacademy.com/">Launch Academy</a> included <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance_testing">acceptance testing</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outside%E2%80%93in_software_development">outside-in development</a>, a follow-up to unit testing and rounding out my knowledge of test-driven development. I expect this organized approach to application development to reduce a lot of the anxiety and frustration around software development that I’ve experienced in the past.</p>

<h3>Check for Doneness</h3>

<p>When learning to code, a natural tendency is to directly go from a user requirement to implementation and then worry about how the user will see the result at the end. But how do you know when you’ve satisfied the requirement? Without an objective test, the requirement can become a moving target that leads to wasted time without improving business value for the customer. Acceptance tests anchor the requirements and provide confidence that the requirement has been met.</p>

<h3>Fix Broken Telephone</h3>

<p>The customer and user of your software are unlikely to be developers themselves. As such, user requirements are provided in plain english and are intended to provide business value. Writing an acceptance test translates the user story into a language that all developers can understand and leads to code that can provide the business value sought after. The methodology of acceptance testing ensures that the translation occurs at high fidelity to reduce errors during implementation.</p>

<h3>Quick Release</h3>

<p>Time is the most expensive resource for the both the developer and customer. The faster a customer can get their solution, the faster they can realize their business value. The faster a developer can complete a project, the faster they can move on to the next project to the keep the business going. Having confidence that the user story has been implemented without errors reduces the likelihood of revisions and leads to faster time to release.</p>

<p>The TDD techniques I’ve learned over the past four weeks have transformed my approach to software development by providing a systematic approach and language with which to turn a user story into a final product that rapidly provides business value.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>At <a href="http://www.launchacademy.com/">Launch Academy</a>, one of our major projects is the breakable toy, a personal project where we can apply the web development skills we&rsquo;ve learned and use the product as a portfolio piece. I&rsquo;ve been kicking around the idea of creating a review website for pre-workout supplements for the past few months and decided to use this opportunity to build it. I believe it&rsquo;s an ideal project for me to apply what I&rsquo;m learning and push myself to create something useful. I&rsquo;m excited to embark on this project since it combines my love for fitness and technology while preparing me for my career in web development.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been a fitness enthusiast for about 20 years and have done a great deal of research on the web to help with my training and supplementation so I&rsquo;m familiar with the domain. It turns out that the majority of product information for supplements is marketing hype. For the average consumer, it&rsquo;s difficult to find the information needed to make a well-informed decision, that can positively or negatively impact health. Given the rise in interest of pre-workout supplements, there&rsquo;s a real need for unbiased information directly from users as well as information about ingredients, including what they do and their safety. I see this site as an information hub dedicated to helping fitness enthusiasts supplement safely.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Tomorrow I will be starting the next phase of <a href="http://www.launchacademy.com" title="Launch Academy">Launch Academy</a>, the part where I get to meet the other students and experience engineers in person and start working and learning in teams. This is my last day of working independently and I wanted to take a moment to reflect on how I got to this point with some thoughts about what lies ahead. I&rsquo;ve spent a great deal of time learning about web development on my own and preparing myself for this program and I&rsquo;m looking forward to finally getting to work with and learn from others who are going through the same journey of reinventing themselves.</p>

<h3>Independent Study</h3>

<p>Up until now, the majority of my training in web technologies has been through independent study. I&rsquo;ve accessed a variety of resources online resources to learn about HTML, CSS, PHP, WordPress and JavaScript. Some of my favorite sites are listed below:</p>

<ul>
<li>  <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com" title="Treehouse">Treehouse</a> - Their quirky instructors and videos make learning fun</li>
<li>  <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/" title="W3 Schools">W3 Schools</a> &ndash; A great reference to help you brush up details</li>
<li>  <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/" title="Codecademy">Codecademy</a> &ndash; Learning by doing done right</li>
<li>  <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/" title="Stack Overflow">Stack Overflow</a> &ndash; Awesome community of helpers to get you unstuck</li>
</ul>


<p>As a beginner, learning independently has been great. I was able to follow the coursework at my own pace in the privacy of my own home and on my own time. I had the freedom to learn what I want to learn and choose the resources I wanted to use based on my learning style. But to take it to the next level I will have work with others and hopefully jumpstart my learning with practical experience.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just completed my first week at <a href="http://www.launchacademy.com/" title="Launch Academy">Launch Academy</a> and it&rsquo;s already been a transformative experience. One of my biggest takeaways from this past week is that software development is more about the human brain and its capacity to solve problems than it is about machines.</p>

<p>Developers have an acronym to describe this phenomenon: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_error" title="User Error">PEBKAC</a> (Problem Exists Between Keyboard and Chair). Turns out we as software developers are the biggest problem facing software development!</p>

<p>The answer to why we are often the cause of our own coding problems is pretty obvious, we don&rsquo;t think like computers. More precisely, we have trouble communicating our needs in sufficient detail and granularity. But how do we more effectively communicate with computers without going crazy?</p>

<p>A universal technique used in problem solving is to break the problem into smaller parts. When you break down a problem, you can more easily focus on the details within each sub-problem and uncover other problems you may have overlooked. The human brain has a better chance at fixing issues when it&rsquo;s given a smaller problem to fix. And smaller problems involve smaller blocks of code and a better chance of being bug-free. Win-win.</p>

<p>Software developers have been breaking down problems from the beginning, but this way of thinking continues to influence new movements in the industry because of it&rsquo;s universality and effectiveness. For example <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development" title="Test-Driven Development">Test-Driven Development</a> is all about testing smaller portions of software continuously during the development process as opposed to waiting until the end. In addition, Source Control Management best practices recommend <a href="http://effectiveprogrammer.com/tip/35/make-atomic-commits" title="Make Atomic Commits">&ldquo;atomic commits&rdquo;</a> or single logical changes to make it easier to revert individual elements and reject others.</p>

<p>For a budding software developer (or anyone learning a new skill) decomposition is an important tool as well. As beginners it&rsquo;s easy to get overwhelmed by the vast body of knowledge to process. As creators, it&rsquo;s also overwhelming to look at a project and not even know where to begin. It&rsquo;s validating to know that the same principles of breaking down problems into smaller and more manageable pieces has a universal truth. The old adage, &ldquo;Take life one day at a time&rdquo; has new meaning for me this week.</p>
